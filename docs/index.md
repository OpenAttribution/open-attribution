# Open Attribution

Open attribution is a project to help developers control their data without resorting to third party control.


## Why do apps NEED attribution?

It's a technical requirement, not a business option. Apps cannot use regular HTTP Urls to connect users, deep links are too limited. Historically MMPs stepped in to help solve this complex problem but by doing so became the arbiters of large amounts of data that some apps may wish to maintain control over.
