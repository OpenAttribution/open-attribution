# Ad Network Conundrum

After having talked to some very helpful people at Countly and other MMPs, it seems this may be the biggest sticking point as the technical knowledge is not well distributed and may ultimately be more business decisions by networks rather than something that will be decided by a technical feasibility.

If this is the case, we will need to address it as soon as possible. There are two interelated issues to be dealt with:

1) Will networks accept click links for clients? If clients self host their attribution on their own domains, how will the networks authenticate the link? My first idea was that this will work first with networks that do not rely on the attribution partner to set the install.
2) The self attributing networks do not send click data (except in aggregate). Thus the self-attribution is not as flexible even for reporting. The self attributing networks may be the hardest to convince. They have large organizations that move slow and may see the least benefit to self-hosted attribution.

I think that the upcoming GDC in San Francisco will be a good time to meet and discuss the issue with more people to see what the best path forward might be.
