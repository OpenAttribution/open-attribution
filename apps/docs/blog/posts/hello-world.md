# Hello world

Well, finally got a blog setup. This was awhile coming and luckily I had some great help from friends. Currently the main WWW site is coming along well and adding the blog was a key point for helping people understand where the project is and it's progression.

Currently, we are still working on the MVP. Most of the flow for the database and dashboard were setup, but without any authentication yet. This will be enough for the MVP, but of course is not something that can be used in production. This is because I'd like to focus on some of the bigger issues incoming like how integrations with ad networks will be handled. 

The next blog post will likely be shared more widely, and thus use my personal site: jamesoclaire.com but will be very related to this project. As I have been moving forward with this I've found more impediments that seem to be business related. Thus I'd like to take a chance to look at this from a birds eye perspective where the current database, APIs for self-hosted attribution is only one of the potential ways to focus on the ultimate goal of giving developers back their data.

Looking forward to a lucky year of the Dragon!
