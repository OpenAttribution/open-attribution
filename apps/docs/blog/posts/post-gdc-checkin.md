# Post GDC 2024

Last week was the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, California which was an opportunity to discuss OpenAttribution with people who are very knowledgeable. I think it continued the trend which showed that the main obstacle to OpenAttribution is the Google and Apple monopolies on the OS and Appstores.

Google and Apple's monopolies afford them the ability to set the terms for attribution that benefit their respective advertising services.

This is further complicated by the other self-attributing networks (SANs) which historically limited the data, specifically the click and impression raw logs, which they were willing to send to attribution partners.

One glimmer of hope is that Snapchat, a SAN, which is now willing to send raw click logs which would help our OpenAttribution platform. Even better, Snapchat has been talking about using deferred deep links and how they could better be utilized to get around the need for complex fingerprinting and probalistic attribution. 

I think this gives some good directions for where to look next.
