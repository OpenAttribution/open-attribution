# Security, Fraud Prevention, and Authentication

Security will be a necessary component of the first MVP, so we will need to keep an eye on these topics: 

## Receipt Validation
- Implement server-side (S2S) receipt validation
  - Verify install receipts and StoreKit transactions
  - Never rely on client-side validation alone

## Apple Authentication Services
- Integrate AdAttributionKit for secure attribution
- Utilize DCDevice for device-level authentication
  - Useful for promo code redemption and special offers

## Geographic Validation
- Implement IP-based geolocation verification
  - Consider using Maxmind for geolocation services
  - Account for Apple Private Relay
    - Uses regional public IPs
    - Provides general area information with reduced precision
  - Handle VPN and proxy considerations
    - Monitor for suspicious traffic patterns
    - Consider policies for Tor network traffic

## App Integrity
- Generate unique keys per app release
- Monitor for suspicious app version and device model combinations
  - Helps identify potential testing attempts
  - Aids in fraud detection
