This project was started around Nov 10th, 2023 and is still very pre-alpha stage. Thus this page will serve to help put some context for how much work is still needed for an MVP product.


## Testing

The testing will be run by `postback-test` which will be run by the development docker. The idea would be for an easily checkable log of all the events that have occured via the frontend dash. Additionally, `postback-test` also checks itself the results in the database, but of course this needs to be replicated on the frontend as well.

Make plan for daily testing regimen for `postback-api`. This is currently pending the `dash-frontend` MVP including the plotting functionality. This will test for:

1. 5x per user: 
- [ ] Test events
- [ ] Test revenue
- [ ] Test retention


#### Marketing & Campaign Management
This is definitely high level, but a good knowledgebase for users would be good. Other MMPs have great resources, and a community managed one would be good as well.

## Data Pipeline & Budget
Keeping an eye on the relative costs of the project for a user to run in the cloud.
