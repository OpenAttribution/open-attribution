I think that superset is still the best choice. It is infact the worst choice for later, but it has a huge pro that it is basically plug and play now. Given that I can't easily change the visuals, it is actually probably best so that it keeps me from spending too much time tinkering with the UI until much later when more of the backend is solidified.

## Superset
Currently been using Superset and finding these issues:
1. It does not drill down very well. The option to right click to drill down is bad UX.
2. It is not flexible, or at least not easy, to implement themes on top. 
3. Filters also seemed a bit tricky

## DIY with Svelte
#### Pros
1. Full control of UX/UI
#### Cons
1. Most work

## Plotly Dash + Svelte
#### Pros
1. Good control of UX/UI
2. Somewhat easy to use dash since I'm familiar with it
#### Cons
1. Is dash truly still being worked on?
2. Drill down also not that great in dash

## Analytics library that friend showed me?
#### Pros
1. Hopeful that it could out of box have support for drilldown
2. Maybe plays better with js + js
#### Cons
1. Completely unknown, so might be hard.
2. Still needs Python backend for db queries.
