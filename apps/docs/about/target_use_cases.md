!!! note
	The self-hosted cost targets are some very aggressive and possibly wishful thinking benchmarks to hit, but should be the goals. The numbers here will also be adjusted over time as the Open Attribution progresses. To be clear, these are not the future pricing of Open Attribution for hosted MMP services but are targets for cloud costs for developers who self-host on their existing cloud provider. 

#### Example use case: Big publisher
Target Cost Per Attributed Install: $0.0003
Target Self Host Cost: $1000/month

100m total installs, 30m installs a month. 3m paid per month
	
Daily Attributed: 1m installs / 300k paid > 1.2m clicks > 100m impressions

Estimate for Attribution (24hr impressions + 7 days clicks + all time attributed installs):
40m all time attributed installs + 10m clicks + 100m impressions  


#### Example use case: Goldilocks Zone Mid Size Game
Target Cost Per Attributed Install: $0.0005
Target Self Host Cost: $125/month

50m total installs, 500k installs a month. 250k paid (attributed) installs per month.
Monthly: 500k installs organic / 250k paid
Daily Attributed: 1600 installs / 800 paid > 3,200 clicks > 320,000 impressions

Estimate for Attribution (24hr impressions + 7 days clicks + all time attributed installs):
20m all time attributed installs + 22,000 clicks + 320,000 impressions  


#### Example use case: Small indie
Target Self Host Cost: $25/month (single server!)
Target Cost Per Attributed Install: $0.005

Totals: 50k total installs
Monthly: 2k installs organic / 5000 paid
Daily Attributed: 70 installs / 170 paid > 650 clicks > 6,500 impressions
